\usage{
HRprocess(cenac, utm, ll, type = "MCP", h = 200, ext = 2, grid = 200,
  sub = "\%Y-\%m", cont = c(50, 95), cumulative = FALSE,
  storepoly = FALSE, div = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{cenac}{centre of activity file}

\item{utm}{a projected coordinate reference system in meters used to accurately estimate area (see \code{\link{CRS}})}

\item{ll}{a geographic coordinate reference system in meters used to accurately estimate area (see \code{\link{CRS}})}

\item{type}{type of activity space metric to calculate. Currently "MCP" for minimum convex polygons,
"fKUD" for fixed KUD and "BBKUD" for Brownian bridge KUD. Defaults to "MCP" when no value provided.}

\item{h}{smoothing factor (in m) associated with error associated with reciever range of passive telemetry system.
Defaults to 200 m if none provided.}

\item{ext}{spatial extent used to calculate probability density metrics of activity space ('fKUD', 'BBKUD')}

\item{grid}{grid size used to calculate probability density metrics of activity space ('fKUD', 'BBKUD')}

\item{sub}{temporal subset used to calculate subsetted activity space metrics.
Currently supports monthly ('\%Y-\%m') or weekly ('\%Y-\%W'). Defaults to monthly.}

\item{cont}{contours of activity space models to estimate areas. Defaults to 50\% and 95\% contours}

\item{cumulative}{TRUE/FALSE, should the operation calculate cumulative activity space areas. Caution
this may take a long time depending on size of dataset.}

\item{storepoly}{TRUE/FALSE, should activity space metrics be saved as spatial objects (polygons or rasters)}

\item{div}{sig1 divisor used to correct BBKUD estimates.}

}
\value{
Produces a list of 2 tibbles containing Overall (full tag life) and Subsetted (user-defined temporal subsets) metrics of activity space.
  If storepoly=TRUE additional object within list containing spatial objects (MCP polygons or KUD rasters).
  Temporal subsets are currently restricted to monthly ('\%Y-\%m') or weekly ('\%Y-\%W'). Cumulative measures across temporal subsets
  included if cumulative=TRUE.

\description{
Internal function to run \code{\link{HRSummary}}.

Input data needs to be setup using \code{\link{setupData}}, and COAs calculated using \code{\link{COA}}.
